- My story and how I got to GitHub
- I am a wireless engineer by trade, and not much of a gamer.
- But a few months ago, I was awakened from a dream about a puzzle game for the iPhone.
- I was given the name of the game and the basic concept of the game.
- I had the name copyrighted and wrote down the concepts I was given in the dream about how the game should operate.
- Afterwards, I made several diagrams as to its layout and its functionality.
- Since then, I’ve been taking some basic swift programming classes and have bought a MAC, downloaded Xcode and started playing with the language.
- It seems a bit overwhelming at the moment, but I know over time that will ease up.
